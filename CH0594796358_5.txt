1. PRODUCT DESCRIPTION
OVERVIEW
The Phoenix With Guaranteed Coupons Worst Of is a product that offers the investor a Coupon which is higher than the Coupon of a comparable standard bond. In
return for this, the investor takes the risk that he will receive the physical deliveryof the worst performing Underlying at the Maturity Date (27 July 2023) of the product.
This will be the case if the Closing Price of at least one of the Underlyings is lower than the Strike (75% of S(0,k)) at the last Valuation Date (20 July 2023). In this
scenario, the Final Redemption Amount will be less than 100% of the Specified Denomination.
In addition, the Notes feature an automatic early redemption option: if on any Valuation Date during the term of the Notes, the performance of each Underlying(k) is
higher than or equal to 0%, the Notes will be automatically redeemed in cash on the Automatic Early Redemption Date immediately following such Valuation Date (and
therefore, prior to the (scheduled) Maturity Date (27 July 2023) of the Notes). The Note will then be redeemed at an amount equal to 100% of the Specified Denomination.
Payments due under the Notes are guaranteed by the Guarantor by a first demand guarantee governed by French law (Paris Courts  having jurisdiction) without
recourse to the Issuer.
