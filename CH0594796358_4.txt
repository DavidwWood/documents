The product described in this document (“Notes”) does not constitute a participation in a collective investment scheme within the meaning of
the Swiss Federal Act on Collective Investment Schemes (“CISA”). Therefore, the Notes are not subject to authorization and supervision by the

supervision by FINMA. Investors in the Notes bear a credit risk on the Issuer and ultimately on the Guarantor.
