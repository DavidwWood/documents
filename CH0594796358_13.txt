sions in respect of each Note:
Scenario 1:
If on Valuation Date(8), WorstPerformance(8) is higher than or equal to -25%, then:
Final Redemption Amount = Specified Denomination x 100%
Scenario 2:

Final Redemption Amount = Physical Delivery Amount(8)
Physical Delivery Amount (8)An integer number of Deliverable Asset(k) determined and calculated pursuant to the following formula:
Physical Delivery Amount(8) = Specified Denomination / Strike(k).
with:
- (k) being the Underlying with the lowest Performance(8,k), provided that if several Underlyings achieve the same lowest
Performance(8,k), the Underlying having the largest market capitalisation is retained;
- The fractional part of this number, if any, is paid in cash: the cash amount denominated in the Specified Currency is calculat-
ed by multiplying (a) the fractional part by (b) the relevant Closing Price of the Underlying as of Valuation Date(8). This cash
amount is rounded up to 4 decimals.Termsheet
